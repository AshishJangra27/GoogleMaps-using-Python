# GoogleMaps-using-Python
This is a python project which gives you every information of any particular area around the world. All you need to give is just a location and an internet connection. Even if you dont have an internet connection and you want to search, you can search any previously reacrched place and it will show you every information of that location include Location name, District name, State name, Country name, Longitude, Lattitide etc. It saves your previous searches into (History.txt) file.
